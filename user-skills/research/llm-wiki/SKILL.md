# Karpathy's LLM Wiki

Build and maintain a persistent, compounding knowledge base as interlinked markdown files.
Based on [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

Unlike traditional RAG (which rediscovers knowledge from scratch per query), the wiki
compiles knowledge once and keeps it current. Cross-references are already there.
Contradictions have already been flagged. Synthesis reflects everything ingested.

**Division of labor:** The human curates sources and directs analysis. The agent
summarizes, cross-references, files, and maintains consistency.

## When This Skill Activates

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to create, build, or start a wiki or knowledge base
- Asks to ingest, add, or process a source into their wiki
- Asks a question and an existing wiki is present at the configured path
- Asks to lint, audit, or health-check their wiki
- References their wiki, knowledge base, or "notes" in a research context

## Wiki Location

**Location:** Set via `WIKI_PATH` environment variable (e.g. in `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/.env`).

If unset, defaults to `~/wiki`.

```bash
WIKI="${WIKI_PATH:-$HOME/wiki}"
```

The wiki is just a directory of markdown files — open it in Obsidian, VS Code, or
any editor. No database, no special tooling required.

## Architecture: Three Layers

```
wiki/
├── SCHEMA.md           # Conventions, structure rules, domain config
├── index.md            # Sectioned content catalog with one-line summaries
├── log.md              # Chronological action log (append-only, rotated yearly)
├── raw/                # Layer 1: Immutable source material
│   ├── articles/       # Web articles, clippings
│   ├── papers/         # PDFs, arxiv papers
│   ├── transcripts/    # Meeting notes, interviews
│   └── assets/         # Images, diagrams referenced by sources
├── entities/           # Layer 2: Entity pages (people, orgs, products, models)
├── concepts/           # Layer 2: Concept/topic pages
├── comparisons/        # Layer 2: Side-by-side analyses
└── queries/            # Layer 2: Filed query results worth keeping
```

**Layer 1 — Raw Sources:** Immutable. The agent reads but never modifies these.
**Layer 2 — The Wiki:** Agent-owned markdown files. Created, updated, and
cross-referenced by the agent.
**Layer 3 — The Schema:** `SCHEMA.md` defines structure, conventions, and tag taxonomy.

## Resuming an Existing Wiki (CRITICAL — do this every session)

When the user has an existing wiki, **always orient yourself before doing anything**:

① **Read `SCHEMA.md`** — understand the domain, conventions, and tag taxonomy.
② **Read `index.md`** — learn what pages exist and their summaries.
③ **Scan recent `log.md`** — read the last 20-30 entries to understand recent activity.

```bash
WIKI="${WIKI_PATH:-$HOME/wiki}"
# Orientation reads at session start
read_file "$WIKI/SCHEMA.md"
read_file "$WIKI/index.md"
read_file "$WIKI/log.md" offset=<last 30 lines>
```

Only after orientation should you ingest, query, or lint. This prevents:
- Creating duplicate pages for entities that already exist
- Missing cross-references to existing content
- Contradicting the schema's conventions
- Repeating work already logged

For large wikis (100+ pages), also run a quick `search_files` for the topic
at hand before creating anything new.

## Initializing a New Wiki

When the user asks to create or start a wiki:

1. Determine the wiki path (from `$WIKI_PATH` env var, or ask the user; default `~/wiki`)
2. Create the directory structure above
3. Ask the user what domain the wiki covers — be specific
4. Write `SCHEMA.md` customized to the domain (see template below)
5. Write initial `index.md` with sectioned header
6. Write initial `log.md` with creation entry
7. Confirm the wiki is ready and suggest first sources to ingest

### SCHEMA.md Template

Adapt to the user's domain. The schema constrains agent behavior and ensures consistency:

```markdown
# Wiki Schema

## Domain
[What this wiki covers — e.g., "AI/ML research", "personal health", "startup intelligence"]

## Conventions
- File names: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces (e.g., `transformer-architecture.md`)
- Every wiki page starts with YAML frontmatter (see below)
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to link between pages (minimum 2 outbound links per page)
- When updating a page, always bump the `updated` date
- Every new page must be added to `index.md` under the correct section
- Every action must be appended to `log.md`
- **Provenance markers:** On pages that synthesize 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source-file.md]`
  at the end of paragraphs whose claims come from a specific source. This lets a reader trace each
  claim back without re-reading the whole raw file. Optional on single-source pages where the
  `sources:` frontmatter is enough.

## Frontmatter
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Page Title
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  type: entity | concept | comparison | query | summary
  tags: [from taxonomy below]
  sources: [raw/articles/source-name.md]
  # Optional quality signals:
  confidence: high | medium | low        # how well-supported the claims are
  contested: true                        # set when the page has unresolved contradictions
  contradictions: [other-page-slug]      # pages this one conflicts with
  ---
  ```

`confidence` and `contested` are optional but recommended for opinion-heavy or fast-moving
topics. Lint surfaces `contested: true` and `confidence: low` pages for review so weak claims
don't silently harden into accepted wiki fact.

### raw/ Frontmatter

Raw sources ALSO get a small frontmatter block so re-ingests can detect drift:

```yaml
---
source_url: https://example.com/article   # original URL, if applicable
ingested: YYYY-MM-DD
sha256: <hex digest of the raw content below the frontmatter>
---
```

The `sha256:` lets a future re-ingest of the same URL skip processing when content is unchanged,
and flag drift when it has changed. Compute over the body only (everything after the closing
`---`), not the frontmatter itself.

## Tag Taxonomy
[Define 10-20 top-level tags for the domain. Add new tags here BEFORE using them.]

Example for AI/ML:
- Models: model, architecture, benchmark, training
- People/Orgs: person, company, lab, open-source
- Techniques: optimization, fine-tuning, inference, alignment, data
- Meta: comparison, timeline, controversy, prediction

Rule: every tag on a page must appear in this taxonomy. If a new tag is needed,
add it here first, then use it. This prevents tag sprawl.

## Page Thresholds
- **Create a page** when an entity/concept appears in 2+ sources OR is central to one source
- **Add to existing page** when a source mentions something already covered
- **DON'T create a page** for passing mentions, minor details, or things outside the domain
- **Split a page** when it exceeds ~200 lines — break into sub-topics with cross-links
- **Archive a page** when its content is fully superseded — move to `_archive/`, remove from index

## Entity Pages
One page per notable entity. Include:
- Overview / what it is
- Key facts and dates
- Relationships to other entities ([[wikilinks]])
- Source references

## Concept Pages
One page per concept or topic. Include:
- Definition / explanation
- Current state of knowledge
- Open questions or debates
- Related concepts ([[wikilinks]])

## Comparison Pages
Side-by-side analyses. Include:
- What is being compared and why
- Dimensions of comparison (table format preferred)
- Verdict or synthesis
- Sources

## Update Policy
When new information conflicts with existing content:
1. Check the dates — newer sources generally supersede older ones
2. If genuinely contradictory, note both positions with dates and sources
3. Mark the contradiction in frontmatter: `contradictions: [page-name]`
4. Flag for user review in the lint report
```

### index.md Template

The index is sectioned by type. Each entry is one line: wikilink + summary.

```markdown
# Wiki Index

> Content catalog. Every wiki page listed under its type with a one-line summary.
> Read this first to find relevant pages for any query.
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD | Total pages: N

## Entities
<!-- Alphabetical within section -->

## Concepts

## Comparisons

## Queries
```

**Scaling rule:** When any section exceeds 50 entries, split it into sub-sections
by first letter or sub-domain. When the index exceeds 200 entries total, create
a `_meta/topic-map.md` that groups pages by theme for faster navigation.

### log.md Template

```markdown
# Wiki Log

> Chronological record of all wiki actions. Append-only.
> Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | subject`
> Actions: ingest, update, query, lint, create, archive, delete
> When this file exceeds 500 entries, rotate: rename to log-YYYY.md, start fresh.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] create | Wiki initialized
- Domain: [domain]
- Structure created with SCHEMA.md, index.md, log.md
```

## Core Operations

### 1. Ingest

When the user provides a source (URL, file, paste), integrate it into the wiki:

① **Capture the raw source:**
   - URL → use `web_extract` to get markdown, save to `raw/articles/`
   - PDF → use `web_extract` (handles PDFs), save to `raw/papers/`
   - Pasted text → save to appropriate `raw/` subdirectory
   - Name the file descriptively: `raw/articles/karpathy-llm-wiki-2026.md`
   - **Add raw frontmatter** (`source_url`, `ingested`, `sha256` of the body).
     On re-ingest of the same URL: recompute the sha256, compare to the stored value —
     skip if identical, flag drift and update if different. This is cheap enough to
     do on every re-ingest and catches silent source changes.

② **Discuss takeaways** with the user — what's interesting, what matters for
   the domain. (Skip this in automated/cron contexts — proceed directly.)

③ **Check what already exists** — search index.md and use `search_files` to find
   existing pages for mentioned entities/concepts. This is the difference between
   a growing wiki and a pile of duplicates.

④ **Write or update wiki pages:**
   - **New entities/concepts:** Create pages only if they meet the Page Thresholds
     in SCHEMA.md (2+ source mentions, or central to one source)
   - **Existing pages:** Add new information, update facts, bump `updated` date.
     When new info contradicts existing content, follow the Update Policy.
   - **Cross-reference:** Every new or updated page must link to at least 2 other
     pages via `[[wikilinks]]`. Check that existing pages link back.
   - **Tags:** Only use tags from the taxonomy in SCHEMA.md
   - **Provenance:** On pages synthesizing 3+ sources, append `^[raw/articles/source.md]`
     markers to paragraphs whose claims trace to a specific source.
   - **Confidence:** For opinion-heavy, fast-moving, or single-source claims, set
     `confidence: medium` or `low` in frontmatter. Don't mark `high` unless the
     claim is well-supported across multiple sources.

⑤ **Update navigation:**
   - Add new pages to `index.md` under the correct section, alphabetically
   - Update the "Total pages" count and "Last updated" date in index header
   - Append to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title`
   - List every file created or updated in the log entry

⑥ **Report what changed** — list every file created or updated to the user.

A single source can trigger updates across 5-15 wiki pages. This is normal
and desired — it's the compounding effect.

### 2. Query

When the user asks a question about the wiki's domain:

① **Read `index.md`** to identify relevant pages.
② **For wikis with 100+ pages**, also `search_files` across all `.md` files
   for key terms — the index alone may miss relevant content.
③ **Read the relevant pages** using `read_file`.
④ **Synthesize an answer** from the compiled knowledge. Cite the wiki pages
   you drew from: "Based on [[page-a]] and [[page-b]]..."
⑤ **File valuable answers back** — if the answer is a substantial comparison,
   deep dive, or novel synthesis, create a page in `queries/` or `comparisons/`.
   Don't file trivial lookups — only answers that would be painful to re-derive.
⑥ **Update log.md** with the query and whether it was filed.

### 3. Lint

When the user asks to lint, health-check, or audit the wiki:

① **Orphan pages:** Find pages with no inbound `[[wikilinks]]` from other pages.
```python
# Use execute_code for this — programmatic scan across all wiki pages
import os, re
from collections import defaultdict
wiki = "<WIKI_PATH>"
# Scan all .md files in entities/, concepts/, comparisons/, queries/
# Extract all [[wikilinks]] — build inbound link map
# Pages with zero inbound links are orphans
```

② **Broken wikilinks:** Find `[[links]]` that point to pages that don't exist.

③ **Index completeness:** Every wiki page should appear in `index.md`. Compare
   the filesystem against index entries.

④ **Frontmatter validation:** Every wiki page must have all required fields
   (title, created, updated, type, tags, sources). Tags must be in the taxonomy.

⑤ **Stale content:** Pages whose `updated` date is >90 days older than the most
   recent source that mentions the same entities.

⑥ **Contradictions:** Pages on the same topic with conflicting claims. Look for
   pages that share tags/entities but state different facts. Surface all pages
   with `contested: true` or `contradictions:` frontmatter for user review.

⑦ **Quality signals:** List pages with `confidence: low` and any page that cites
   only a single source but has no confidence field set — these are candidates
   for either finding corroboration or demoting to `confidence: medium`.

⑧ **Source drift:** For each file in `raw/` with a `sha256:` frontmatter, recompute
   the hash and flag mismatches. Mismatches indicate the raw file was edited
   (shouldn't happen — raw/ is immutable) or ingested from a URL that has since
   changed. Not a hard error, but worth reporting.

⑨ **Page size:** Flag pages over 200 lines — candidates for splitting.

⑩ **Tag audit:** List all tags in use, flag any not in the SCHEMA.md taxonomy.

⑪ **Log rotation:** If log.md exceeds 500 entries, rotate it.

⑫ **Report findings** with specific file paths and suggested actions, grouped by
   severity (broken links > orphans > source drift > contested pages > stale content > style issues).

⑬ **Append to log.md:** `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | N issues found`

⑭ **Source verification (源码交叉验证):** When a wiki page claims facts about external
   source code (operation counts, function lists, index mappings), verify by extracting
   ground truth with grep + aggregation + diff. Full recipe in
   `references/source-verification.md`. This catches counting errors (e.g., w/r/d/u
   mismatches), summary table arithmetic, and stale claims after upstream source changes.

## Working with the Wiki

### Searching

```bash
# Find pages by content
search_files "transformer" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Find pages by filename
search_files "*.md" target="files" path="$WIKI"

# Find pages by tag
search_files "tags:.*alignment" path="$WIKI" file_glob="*.md"

# Recent activity
read_file "$WIKI/log.md" offset=<last 20 lines>
```

### Bulk Ingest

When ingesting multiple sources at once, batch the updates:
1. Read all sources first
2. Identify all entities and concepts across all sources
3. Check existing pages for all of them (one search pass, not N)
4. Create/update pages in one pass (avoids redundant updates)
5. Update index.md once at the end
6. Write a single log entry covering the batch

### Archiving

When content is fully superseded or the domain scope changes:
1. Create `_archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move the page to `_archive/` with its original path (e.g., `_archive/entities/old-page.md`)
3. Remove from `index.md`
4. Update any pages that linked to it — replace wikilink with plain text + "(archived)"
5. Log the archive action

### Obsidian Integration

The wiki directory works as an Obsidian vault out of the box:
- `[[wikilinks]]` render as clickable links
- Graph View visualizes the knowledge network
- YAML frontmatter powers Dataview queries
- The `raw/assets/` folder holds images referenced via `![[image.png]]`

For best results:
- Set Obsidian's attachment folder to `raw/assets/`
- Enable "Wikilinks" in Obsidian settings (usually on by default)
- Install Dataview plugin for queries like `TABLE tags FROM "entities" WHERE contains(tags, "company")`

If using the Obsidian skill alongside this one, set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` to the
same directory as the wiki path.

### Obsidian Headless (servers and headless machines)

On machines without a display, use `obsidian-headless` instead of the desktop app.
It syncs vaults via Obsidian Sync without a GUI — perfect for agents running on
servers that write to the wiki while Obsidian desktop reads it on another device.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Requires Node.js 22+
npm install -g obsidian-headless

# Login (requires Obsidian account with Sync subscription)
ob login --email <email> --password '<password>'

# Create a remote vault for the wiki
ob sync-create-remote --name "LLM Wiki"

# Connect the wiki directory to the vault
cd ~/wiki
ob sync-setup --vault "<vault-id>"

# Initial sync
ob sync

# Continuous sync (foreground — use systemd for background)
ob sync --continuous
```

**Continuous background sync via systemd:**
```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/obsidian-wiki-sync.service
[Unit]
Description=Obsidian LLM Wiki Sync
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/ob sync --continuous
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/wiki
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now obsidian-wiki-sync
# Enable linger so sync survives logout:
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

This lets the agent write to `~/wiki` on a server while you browse the same
vault in Obsidian on your laptop/phone — changes appear within seconds.

## Style: Chinese Technical Writing (中文技术写作风格)

This user prefers conversational, 口语化的 Chinese for all wiki content — the way
a senior engineer explains something to a colleague over lunch, not the way a paper
or official doc reads.

Do NOT:
- Write in academic/formal tone (学术论文腔)
- Use jargon-heavy headings like "架构：两级过滤器串联" 
- Use bullet-point-heavy structure that reads like a spec document
- Assume the reader already knows all the terms

DO:
- Use everyday section titles like "这东西解决什么问题", "为什么简单的正则不行"
- Explain using concrete examples with step-by-step walkthroughs ("第1块: \"...\"")
- Use metaphors and everyday language ("脑子里记着三件事", "半个标签扣在我这里")
- End with a one-sentence summary in plain language
- Keep all technical detail, just package it in human language

The test: if you read a section aloud and it sounds like you're reading a whitepaper,
rewrite it.

## Writing Style (Chinese User)

When writing wiki pages in Chinese for this user, follow these conventions —
they override the formal/academic tone typical of technical documentation:

- **Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee.** Use everyday
  spoken Chinese (口语化), not academic prose. The reader is a human, not a journal editor.
- **Headings should be questions or statements** that a person would actually
  say: "这东西解决什么问题" not "概述", "为什么简单的正则不行" not "技术局限性".
- **Use everyday metaphors and mental models.** "脑子里记着三件事", "半个标签扣在我这里",
  "一刀切掉" — these are more memorable than abstract descriptions.
- **Don't cut technical content.** All facts, code references, and source citations
  stay. Only the packaging changes — swap formal wrappers for conversational ones.
- **Lead with the problem, not the definition.** Start with "为什么要做这个" before
  "它是什么". The reader should understand the motivation before the mechanism.
- **End with a one-sentence core takeaway.** After all the detail, give the reader
  a single sentence they can remember and repeat. "核心就一句话：...".

This user has explicitly corrected wiki output that was too academic, preferring
the conversational version produced in a mid-session summary. When in doubt, err
toward spoken language over formal prose.

- **Never modify files in `raw/`** — sources are immutable. Corrections go in wiki pages.
- **Always orient first** — read SCHEMA + index + recent log before any operation in a new session.
  Skipping this causes duplicates and missed cross-references.
- **Always update index.md and log.md** — skipping this makes the wiki degrade. These are the
  navigational backbone.
- **Don't create pages for passing mentions** — follow the Page Thresholds in SCHEMA.md. A name
  appearing once in a footnote doesn't warrant an entity page.
- **Don't create pages without cross-references** — isolated pages are invisible. Every page must
  link to at least 2 other pages.
- **Frontmatter is required** — it enables search, filtering, and staleness detection.
- **Tags must come from the taxonomy** — freeform tags decay into noise. Add new tags to SCHEMA.md
  first, then use them.
- **Keep pages scannable** — a wiki page should be readable in 30 seconds. Split pages over
  200 lines. Move detailed analysis to dedicated deep-dive pages.
- **Ask before mass-updating** — if an ingest would touch 10+ existing pages, confirm
  the scope with the user first.
- **Rotate the log** — when log.md exceeds 500 entries, rename it `log-YYYY.md` and start fresh.
  The agent should check log size during lint.
- **Handle contradictions explicitly** — don't silently overwrite. Note both claims with dates,
  mark in frontmatter, flag for user review.

## Pitfalls

- **Don't treat OKF or Rohit V2 as an upgrade path.** OKF is an exchange format (not a wiki engine),
  Rohit V2 is a design document (agentmemory is its implementation but it's session memory, not a
  curated wiki), and Karpathy wiki is a curated knowledge base. They share the same physical layer
  (markdown + frontmatter + directory) but solve different problems. The user's wiki should not be
  "migrated" to OKF or V2 — add capabilities incrementally instead.
- **Don't overcomplicate small wikis.** For wikis under 50 pages, confidence scoring, knowledge
  graphs, and hybrid search add complexity without proportional value. The llm-wiki skill's
  existing ingest/lint/query flow is sufficient. Add capabilities only when the pain is real
  (index.md too long to read, cross-references too complex for wikilinks, etc.).
- **Don't confuse agentmemory with a wiki upgrade.** agentmemory remembers coding sessions\n  (episodic memory); llm-wiki stores curated sources (semantic knowledge). They can coexist\n  but don't replace each other.\n- **The Hermes agentmemory plugin's MemoryProvider is orthogonal to the `memory` tool.**\n  Setting `memory.provider: agentmemory` in config.yaml swaps the context-injection layer (prefetch),\n  but the built-in `memory` tool continues writing to MEMORY.md as before. The plugin's\n  `on_memory_write()` only mirrors to agentmemory — it doesn't replace anything. Do not\n  discourage the user from trying agentmemory because of fear that it will break their\n  existing memory/wiki setup.
- **Verify PR state before reporting capability.** Inline docs like `.env.example` can be
  stale — this session incorrectly said DeepSeek was unsupported because the file said
  "PR #307 will extend" when it was already merged (2026-05-16). Always check the actual
  PR merge state, not just inline comments.
- **"不进搜索 ≠ 白算了".** When writing wiki pages that classify data by whether it's
  searchable, do NOT write summary conclusions like "X data is not searchable, therefore
  wasted." Data can be consumed through other paths: context injection (mem::context loads
  profiles/lessons/summaries/slots into every LLM turn), consolidation cycles (semantic
  and procedural are read-write merged), API reads (sketches via sketch-read), or mesh
  sync. Only call data "dead" if you've verified zero reads in the source (e.g.,
  enrichedChunks: 1 write, 0 reads). Otherwise say exactly how it IS consumed.
- **Hermes credential redaction blocks writing API keys via `write_file`.** When configuring
  agentmemory or any external service that needs a `.env` file, the `write_file` tool will
  silently replace key values with `***`. Workaround: use `terminal` with `cat > file << 'EOF'`
  heredoc, or have the user manually edit. After writing, verify with `execute_code` — it can
  read the actual bytes (redaction only affects tool display output, not filesystem).

## Related Tools

[llm-wiki-compiler](https://github.com/atomicmemory/llm-wiki-compiler) is a Node.js CLI that
compiles sources into a concept wiki with the same Karpathy inspiration. It's Obsidian-compatible,
so users who want a scheduled/CLI-driven compile pipeline can point it at the same vault this
skill maintains. Trade-offs: it owns page generation (replaces the agent's judgment on page
creation) and is tuned for small corpora. Use this skill when you want agent-in-the-loop curation;
use llmwiki when you want batch compile of a source directory.

## Related Formats

**Open Knowledge Format (OKF) + Rohit V2 + agentmemory** — consolidated reference at
`references/okf-and-agentmemory.md`. Covers:

- **OKF** (Google Cloud Platform, v0.1): vendor-neutral knowledge exchange format. Same physical
  substrate (markdown + YAML + directory) but untyped links for minimal interop. NOT a wiki engine.
- **Rohit LLM Wiki V2** (gist): extends Karpathy with memory lifecycle, typed knowledge graphs,
  hybrid search, event-driven hooks. Pure design doc — no code.
- **agentmemory** (23K+ stars, npm): the actual implementation of V2 concepts as a local-first
  memory service for coding agents. NOT a wiki — remembers coding sessions, not curated sources.
  Uses local embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~80MB) for vector search + LLM API for compression.

**Key insight**: OKF is for exchange, Rohit V2 is for design, agentmemory is for session memory,
llm-wiki is for curated knowledge. They share the same physical layer but solve different problems.

Load `references/okf-and-agentmemory.md` when the user asks about scaling their wiki to enterprise
level, about OKF adoption, or about how Rohit V2 / agentmemory relate to their existing wiki.
